Whom you will be talking with when putting a call is determined by an algorithm. It could be someone close to you or someone miles away.

In its obsessive seriality and clinical presentation, the installation both mimics and subverts curatorial logic, leaving the viewer caught between observer and observed. \n\n180 photographic pieces, single installation'
